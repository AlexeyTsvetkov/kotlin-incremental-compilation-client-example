This project shows how to use Kotlin Incremental Compilation API.
This API is not stable yet.

The project contains just one test.
To run the test:
```
./gradlew test
```

You can also open the project from Intellij IDEA. If you have not run tests with Gradle, you need to download Kotlin runtime for tests by running:
```
./gradlew copyKotlinRuntimeForTests
```
